## 💡 Project Motivation
With over 10 years of experience as a Sales Engineer in the Cutting Tools and CNC industry, I realized that the biggest challenge manufacturers face is **"Unexpected Machine Breakdown."** This leads to significant financial losses in both repair costs and lost production time.

I created this project to bridge the gap between **Engineering domain knowledge** and **Data Science**. By leveraging Machine Learning, the system predicts failures before they happen, while Generative AI acts as an on-demand technical consultant to solve operational issues.

## 🚀 Key Features

The dashboard consists of 4 main modules:

### 1. 🤖 AI Technical Consultant
* Powered by **Google Gemini (GenAI)** to serve as an intelligent technical assistant.
* Users can ask for immediate troubleshooting advice, such as *"How to fix Chipping?"*, *"Explain Insert Grades"*, or *"Recommended Cutting Speed?"*.

### 2. 📊 Historical Failure Insights
* Deep dive into historical operation data (Exploratory Data Analysis).
* Compares parameters between **Normal** and **Failure** states to identify root causes.
* Visualizes complex data into easy-to-understand charts.

### 3. 🔮 Cutting Condition Simulation
* **The Heart of the Project:** Utilizes Machine Learning models (XGBoost/Random Forest).
* Allows users to adjust **RPM, Torque, and Tool Wear** in real-time.
* Instantly calculates the **Failure Probability** based on the input parameters.

### 4. 💰 Financial Impact & ROI
* Translates technical metrics into **Business Value ($)**.
* Provides a clear cost comparison between **Run-to-Failure (Reactive)** vs. **Preventive Maintenance (Proactive)** strategies.
* Calculates Return on Investment (ROI) to support executive decision-making.
